Question : 
Assume you are asked to get your code running in the cloud using AWS. 
What tools and AWS services would you use to deploy the API, database, and a scheduled version of your data ingestion code? 
Write up a description of your approach.

Answer : 
To deploy this project in AWS, I would containerize the FastAPI application using Docker and run it on Amazon ECS with Fargate, which provides serverless container orchestration. 
The PostgreSQL database would be hosted on Amazon RDS. 
For the ingestion pipeline, I would use a scheduled AWS Lambda function, triggered via Amazon EventBridge, to process weather data files stored in Amazon S3. 
Secrets such as database credentials would be managed securely with AWS Secrets Manager. 
Logs and performance metrics would be collected using Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and debugging. 
This approach ensures a architecture which is clean, maintains separation of concerns, implements automation for data loading, provides scalability, and has a ease of maintenance in a production-ready cloud environment.
